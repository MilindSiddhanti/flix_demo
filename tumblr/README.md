## Notes

It is a simple application to display the images given any API output. Should map the output of the API to the relevant fields to alter the view options to the user. Pull to refresh option is available to refresh the images based on the output given by the API. Latest images added will be displayed first when the pull to refresh action is completed. If there isn't any updates, the same structure of the images will be displayed.
